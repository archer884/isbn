Tiny cli app for validating ISBNs

In theory, I want to add a feature to let you generate a check digit from a sequence of values, but that isn't here right now.

...Really, neither is anything else that would kind of make it... You know... A program.

    Usage: isbn <number>

The program just spits out whether or not the number is valid and, if not, why not. You can supply any number of ISBNs to test.
